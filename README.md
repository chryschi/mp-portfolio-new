# [MP Portfolio Website](https://mp-portfolio-preview.netlify.app/aktuelles) (for an architect)

I'm currently working on a portfolio website for a friend, who provided the desired design.
_This is a personal project, not a paid one._

## Features

- Clickable, scrollable and dragable carousel for every content and project page

## Used Technologies

Vite, React, HTML/CSS/JS

## Challenges

- Code carousel from scratch (for learning purposes)
  - make it work for arbitrary image widths
  - using arrow button let image on the left always stop at a fixed position (aligning with header text)

## Future Features

- Enhance Responsiveness of website
- Icon animations (e.g. menu icon transitionin into X icon)
- Custom scrollbar for project description view
- Page transitions
- Styled error page

## Future Bug Fixes

- [x] carousel behaving as expected when trying to drag it or navigate with arrow buttons
- [] carousel has always full length regardless of screen width
- [] scrollbar only appears when necessary
